##Data
Copy your data into the two sub-directories DRIVE and STARE inside the directory Data.
To save space, we have removed any image data from many of the sub-directories however, we have kept the empty directory there so that you may still be able to use the same path for a sub-directory. This is to help you to retain the hierarchy of the folders.
